1. Start a new  project:- pr2
django-admin startproject pr2

2. cd pr2
3. create a file -> views.py

4. Now create a functions in views.py

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse('''Harry django CodeWithHarry''')

def about(request):
    return HttpResponse("About HarryBhai")

First of all, we have imported the HttpResponse object from django.http module.
Whenever a user requests a page, Django creates an HttpRequest object that contains the metadata of the request.
 After creating an HttpRequest object, Django passes this object inside the view function as the first argument. 
Hence, a specific HttpResponse is generated for each view function.

5. Now open the urls.py file and define diff urls

so first 
from . import views -> means we are in same dir so we import views from It

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',views.index,name='index'),
    path('about/',views.about,name='about'),
]

What is the path function?

    Path function is contained within the django.urls module.
    It helps in routing URLs to the appropriate view function within a Django project.

Now, let's discuss the arguments passed in the path function.

      1. about/: It is the endpoint of the URL. 

         Example: Let's suppose a user tries to access https://www.codewithharry.com/blog/. 
         In this URL, 'blog' is the endpoint. 

       2. views.about: It is the function defined in the views.py file. 
       Here, we pass the function that should be executed whenever someone tries to access 
       our website's 'about' page. 

       3. name='about': It is the name of the path. 
       Naming a path will help us to access it from anywhere in our project. 
       In the future, we will see how to access a path from templates.
